## Introduction

**LuminaChain** is a next-generation blockchain platform designed to offer unparalleled scalability, security, and interoperability. Our mission is to empower developers and enterprises to build decentralized applications (dApps) with ease, surpassing the limitations of existing blockchain solutions like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

## Features

- **High Scalability:** Capable of processing thousands of transactions per second (TPS) with low latency.
- **Robust Security:** Advanced cryptographic techniques ensure data integrity and protection against attacks.
- **Interoperability:** Seamlessly connects with other blockchains and legacy systems.
- **Smart Contracts:** Support for Turing-complete smart contracts to enable complex decentralized applications.
- **Energy Efficient:** Utilizes a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism to minimize energy consumption.
- **Developer-Friendly:** Comprehensive SDKs and APIs for easy integration and development.

## Lumina Coin

**Lumina Coin (LUM)** is the native cryptocurrency of the LuminaChain ecosystem. It serves multiple purposes, including:

- **Transaction Fees:** Used to pay for transactions and smart contract executions on the network.
- **Staking:** Holders can stake LUM to participate in the network's consensus mechanism and earn rewards.
- **Governance:** LUM holders can propose and vote on protocol upgrades and changes.
- **Incentives:** Rewards for developers and participants contributing to the ecosystem.

## Technology Stack

- **Consensus Mechanism:** Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
- **Programming Languages:** Solidity, Rust, Go
- **Smart Contract Platform:** EVM-compatible
- **Database:** Distributed ledger technology
- **Networking:** Peer-to-peer (P2P) network architecture
